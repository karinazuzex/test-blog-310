                            Changes in the trading prices can be critical. Trading companies need to detect
                            any sudden changes and react instantly. <br />
                            This fast reaction is not possible to acchieve using traditional disk-based
                            systems. To meet the challenging requirements for analyzing mass amounts of data
                            and servicing requests within milliseconds, an in-memory cache is a must. Memurai
                            can ingest data at a high rate (ultra fast write and read speed).
                            <br /> Memurai is a high-performance cache that delivers sub-milliseconds response
                            time, high availability and seamless integration with Windows.
                            <br /> Memurai is a fully-supported enterprise platform that meets the most
                            demanding production workloads.

                            The scalability of an in-memory caching makes it the perfect solution for spikes
                            of application usage. A common use case for this scenario is seasonal periods like
                            Black Friday, sports events or any other high traffic demanding period when your
                            business needs to be up to the challenge. A high throughput in-memory cache solves
                            this situation allowing you to address this only when necessary without having to
                            increase your cost year around for specific moments in time.

                            When talking about user sessions, database scalability and reliability are
                            absolutely critical to delivering a great user experience. Caching the user data
                            information speeds up response time to the application user. Because of the
                            complexity and volume of data can be massive, a key-value database that delivers
                            single-digit millisecond performance at scale itâ€™s the right answer. This will not
                            only translate into a faster and better experience but it will reduce as well the
                            cost for your business.

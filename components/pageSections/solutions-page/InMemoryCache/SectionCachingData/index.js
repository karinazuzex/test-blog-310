                            A cache-aside is the most common way to use Memurai as in-memory cache. The data
                            is only loaded when necessary. In this strategy when your application need to read
                            data from the database it will check first the cache to determine if the data itâ€™s
                            available. If it return a cache hit (data is available) the response is issued to
                            the caller. If it return a cache miss (data not available) the database is queried
                            for the data. Lazy-loading cache is straightforward, keep the cache size cost
                            effective and can produce immediate performance benefits.

                            The write-through cache strategy favors data consistency between the cache and the
                            datastore since the cache is proactively updating immediately when the database is
                            updated or data is added. Thanks to this the data in the cache is never stale. The
                            disadvantage if this strategy is that infrequently requested data is also written
                            to the cache, resulting in a larger and more expensive cache. For this reason this
                            strategy is usually implemented along the lazy-load cache.

                            Write-behind strategy is suitable for high read & write throughput system since
                            the developer writes only to one place improving this way write performance. The
                            data in this strategy is first written to the cache and asynchronously synced to
                            the datastore. For this strategy some rollback processes are suggested to be
                            in-place to maintain consistency over a time window.
